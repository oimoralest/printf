.Nd format and print data. 
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION       
The function printf() produces output according to a format as described below. The function printf() writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. This function works with the <std.arg> for call a list of arguments.

.Sh Return value
.Pp                  
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.Sh Format of the format of string
.Pp
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.Sh The conversion specifier
.Pp
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are: 
.Bl -tag -width -indent  
.It d, i           
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1.
.It  c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.It  s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.It  %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
